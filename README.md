### Hello!

I'm an experienced software engineer with 8 years of experience. 

My journey began with iogames.space, a web platform I built and scaled to **over 2 million monthly users**, fueling my passion for delivering quality software at scale.

Since then, Iâ€™ve architected, designed, and implemented **30+** software applications, with a focus on helping software developers discover great open source projects and level-up their skills. 

As of 2023, my projects have collectively reached **over 27 million users**.

Here are a handful Iâ€™m most proud of:

- Architected, designed, and developed an email marketing SaaS platform with 15+ features including an advanced WYSIWYG editor, email performance analytics, embeddable sign-up forms, and more. (52x Grow)

- Built the Theme Studio for VS Code - It reached #1 on Hacker News and continues to delight thousands of software developers each month. I replicated the entire VS Code interface with plain-old CSS (and lots of coffee).

- Helped over 3,000,000+ software engineers research and discover great open source resources through the various websites I've created.

- Trained hundreds of developers on advanced usage of VS Code through an online course, with an average **4.7 stars** rating.
